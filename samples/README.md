# Samples

Here are samples demonstrating functionality of the SDK. 

- [OAuth tokens](oauth/OAuthDemo)

<!--TODO: Craig iOS OTP app - [One-time passwords (OTP)](otp)-->

- [Certificate pinning](certificate-pinning.md)

- [QR code scanning](qr-code-scanning.md)

> Note that all samples depend on the SDK, ensure your development environment is configured beforehand.


## SDK Installation

Open your project folder and copy the debug framework into `Frameworks/Debug` folder and the release framework into `Frameworks/Release` folder.

For more information, see [Getting the SDK](getting-the-sdk.md#xcode-setup).

Jazzydoc is available in the package there but not on this repository.
